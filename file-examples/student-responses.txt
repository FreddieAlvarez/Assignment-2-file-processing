I really enjoyed the backend development course. The Node.js modules were challenging but rewarding.
This course was harder than I expected. JavaScript in Node.js is different from browser JavaScript.
Backend development is fascinating. I never realized how much work happens behind the scenes.
The course moved quickly but covered important concepts. File processing seemed complicated initially.
Great course for learning Node.js fundamentals. The examples were practical and relevant.
